Unlike other AI tools that lose track of story elements as documents grow longer, Claude Desktop maintains perfect continuity across feature-length projects.\\n\\nBut the real game-changer is the **Desktop Commander MCP addon**. This integration allows Claude to write directly to your local files with perfect formatting, maintain story bibles and character consistency documents, and track revisions throughout the development process.\\n\\nThe 15-minute feature film script isn't just possible‚Äîit's the new standard for rapid creative development. Your first professional screenplay is just 15 minutes away."
